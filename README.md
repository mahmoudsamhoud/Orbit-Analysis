# Orbit-Analysis
Orbit analysis is a necessary tool for vibration analysis of rotating machinery. The process is essentially an extension of time waveform analysis plotting time-domain data from a pair of orthogonal probes on an orbit graph with consideration for the physical location of the proximity probes
